Hi all! New stack (node.js), new blog!

If you are new to node, you may find here interesting stuff for you to crack on (stay tunned)

I will post here some difficulties I had when I started working with node and express, interesting tools or modules, and infrastructure tricks to try and make the most of node.js

Thinks to cover (coming soon):

 * Creating a REST service in node.js
 * First application with express.js (MVC framework for node.js)
 * Installing a node.js application on EC2.
 * Using haproxy and fraggle to build a hot deployment, multi version scenario.
 * Some example code..
 * Consuming the REST service from iOS application
 * ...
